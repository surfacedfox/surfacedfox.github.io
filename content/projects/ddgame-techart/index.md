'DDGame' is a long term, high production value game project that I've been working on for a good bit. Using the powerful Unreal Engine has allowed us to
aim high as a small team. To bolster our efforts towards this game, and to make art direction and kitbashing easier, I wrote a few shaders and set up an art pipeline/workflow for collaborators. These are some highlights of the technical art and the pipeline utilized by the project.

Still a little wip; check back later!
