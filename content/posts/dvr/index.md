Sometimes I'm really glad that DVR is a thing.<!--more-->

I revisited the game that *really* got me into making games, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time recently. While playing, I ran into this fun little situation:

After a second to process what just happened, I quickly hit alt+f10 and saved this clip. DVR rules because it allows you to capture absolutely insane stuff like this one (You may alternatively know it by one of its several names: Nvidia Shadowplay, Radeon ReLive, Steam Background Recording; ultimately the goal is the same-- keep a running recording of your screen and you can clip the last minute/whatever of it).  

Honestly, what do you even do with a situation like this? Maybe this *is* exactly what the developers at Ubisoft Montreal faced and decided to just let it roll, just in case. :)  

I've been told that this was a perfect vault, too-- if I was even a little closer to the ledge, the prince would've grabbed on to it.
