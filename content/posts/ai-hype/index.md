I don't think we'll get "AGI" just yet.<!--more-->

What if the only people *actually* hyped about and using AI are execs and techbros as usual and this whole thing is going to burst like NFTs or crypto? I used to think that unlike NFTs/Crypto this at least had *some* use but why do I feel we're nearing diminishing returns territory. Current methods of enhancing AI capabilities seem to be based on giving it *more--* more training data, more computational power. What happens once we've run out of all possible training data? Do we just start cannibalising generated outputs?  

Not to diminish the very real issue of mass theft and job losses because said execs are the ones in power but I can't help but feel like this gimmick is far from becoming "the next internet" and if we weather this storm, they'll backpedal all that AI slop like they did with crypto/NFTs? I wonder what the next shiny new toy will be. 🤔
