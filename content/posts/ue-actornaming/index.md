Confused about what each actor name function does? Here’s a handy dandy list for that.<!--more--> 
***
- `GetName()` value, when auto generated, can change run over run. In my tests development and shipping builds actually had differently generated names. If you do change name in editor than that stays the same run over run.
- `GetFName()` returns same value but as FName.
- `GetFullGroupName()` returns level by default.
- `GetFullName(true)` returns full unique name. For example, for pawns it would return `MyCppPawn /Game/FirstPersonCPP/Maps/UEDPIE_0_FirstPersonExampleMap.FirstPersonExampleMap:PersistentLevel.MyCppPawn10` and for StaticMeshComponent it would return `StaticMeshComponent /Script/Engine.Default__DefaultPawn:MeshComponent0`.
- Actors have `HumanReadableName()` method which currently just returns `GetName()`.
- Actors have `GetDebugName(actor)` method which currently just returns `Actor.GetName()` if actor != nullptr.
- Actors have `ActorLabel` property and `GetActorLabel()` but both of which is editor only which means your code will fail to compile if you tried to package a shipping build with that call. These are useful in editor tools however since this is the editor-user-facing name of the Actor.
- There is `UKismetSystemLibrary::GetDisplayName()` which returns label in editor mode otherwise `owner.GetName() + component.GetName()`.

As the autogenerated names are not stable, current recommendation is to either explicitly name things in editor OR use tags on actor which can be checked using `ActorHasTag(name)` method.
