## Here are some projects I'm proud of!
- [Here](https://imgur.com/a/T1CR4UV) is an evolving Imgur gallery of my eclectic work.
- [XScape](https://axoverse.io/docs/), a realtime 3D data visualisation platform. I have been working on this one at my job for over a year and it's actively in use right now by a major hospital in Singapore!
- [Technical Assignment for Hopscotch Games](https://youtu.be/20y3zrsYus4): Video of the technical assessment project I worked on as a part of my job application at [Hopscotch Games](https://www.hopscotchgames.org/). Built according to [this spec sheet,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tMqqku5wOYLQ3Es-JAFIMSDDns-QxTBM5_Au68DEmI8/edit) I've been told that my project far exceeded their expectations.
- [Render Pipeline Conversion](https://imgur.com/gallery/7HEnktL): I converted the Unity HDRP sample project to URP, gaining a massive performance boost for minimal fidelity differences!
- [Wizards' Folly](https://teamfiredreamer.itch.io/wizards-gmtk-2022): A game I made with [Team Firedreamer](https://www.firedreamer.com) for GMTK Jam 2022!
