Hi! I'm [@surfacedfox](https://www.twitter.com/surfacedfox), and I'm a creator!

Inspired to make games since I was 11 and with 7 years of professional experience, I've picked up a multitude of skills in service of that goal. Be it designing and developing complex systems, or
setting up a pipeline to facilitate a smooth development process, I can bridge the gap between the worlds of art and engineering. I believe interactivity is the future of storytelling, and that the best way to predict the future is to make it happen- so here we are!

Previously, I worked with [Hopscotch Games](https://www.hopscotchgames.org/) on three upcoming titles: a narrative game about a person's love life, an arcadey version of pinewood derby, and a massive space-themed RPG. I also designed, developed and ideated [Aabhas Technologies' suite of B2B applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORNc7UC88AQ).

I have also:

* Been working on my own small game project.
* Acted as a moderator at The Bicyclists, a safe space for LGBTQIA+ folks.
* Been learning to play the guitar.
* Served as a teaching assistant at the B.K. Birla College, Kalyan, during my undergrad education...
* ...and taught final year undergrad students Game Programming at Acuity Educare, an education and certifications school.

I strive to work towards developing games that go beyond the screen and reach players' hearts, and to make the game industry a better, safer, more diverse and mature one. My biggest inspirations in gaming are John Romero, Teddy Dief, Tim Sweeney, Chris Crawford, Jessica Gonzalez, Delaney King, Rami Ismail and J. W. Nijman, Ren Alex-Rose and Freya Holm√©r; and my all time favourite games are Skyrim, Fallout: New Vegas, Control, Scarlet Nexus, Celeste, Disco Elysium and Rise To Honor(PS2).

(P.S., seriously, check out Rise To Honor, it's got a really fun, innovative control scheme and it really delivers a solid "Hong Kong action movie" experience, especially on a CRT screen!)
