## Here are some projects I'm proud of!

- [Technical Assignment for Hopscotch Games](https://youtu.be/20y3zrsYus4): Video of the technical assessment project I worked on as a part of my job application at [Hopscotch Games](https://www.hopscotchgames.org/). Built according to [this spec sheet,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tMqqku5wOYLQ3Es-JAFIMSDDns-QxTBM5_Au68DEmI8/edit) I've been told that my project far exceeded their expectations.
- [Render Pipeline Conversion](https://imgur.com/gallery/7HEnktL): I converted the Unity HDRP sample project to URP, gaining a massive performance boost for minimal fidelity differences!
- [Wizards' Folly](https://teamfiredreamer.itch.io/wizards-gmtk-2022): A game I made with [Team Firedreamer](https://www.firedreamer.com) for GMTK Jam 2022!
- [itch.io Page](https://surfacedfox.itch.io/): My jam games on itch.io made independently.
- [2020 Gameplay Demoreel](https://youtu.be/mAmGVIGsmtY): A reel of stuff I worked in 2020: Movement systems, character switching, a couple games and more!

#### My previous employer made me remove my online presence and delete my previous account, @nomad_ashe. As a result, I don't really have the source code to a lot of this stuff anymore. :(
