As aptly pointed out in Jacob Geller's video, [A Thousand Ways of Seeing a Forest](https://youtu.be/JgQ_buy8xJ0), videogames, or any art for that matter, are an exercise in 
translation; Translating an experience to an interactive form, paper, music, or words.  
Jacob juxtaposes this concept with several translations of a Tang-dynasty poem, where the same Mandarin words could be interpreted in several ways when translated to English. What
do the translators see, and focus on when doing so? What does it say of their biases?  
  
Today, having spent countless nights trying to build a coherent visual style for Deus Dawn, I find myself reminded of that exact thing. When the scope broadened, it shifted to a more holistic game environment as opposed to only focusing on the cold concrete greige of corporate offices and picket-fenced suburban sprawl. With that, came the need to show a civilisation of people beyond the walls of these corporate scrip towns-- people living in a Star-Trek like post-capitalist, currenciless utopia. They have their own systems of computing, an interconnected network to exchange information, and sustainable energy sources.  
  
I referred to Jane Ng's talk on Firewatch's art style, and found confirmation that Jacob's observation that the environments of the game harken back to national park posters issued by the US government. And for a split-second, like an indecisive monkey, I was about to jump to aping that style when I got reminded once again-- games are an exercise in translation.  
  
I know what the subject of my translation is: a feeling of refuge after wading through dark forests, a mix of wires running about and being used as perches by some birds, a ray of light shooting upwards from the centre of each settlement, as if to say, "Come here! I beckon you to enjoy the gifts of nature and technology working together!", the awe of stumbling upon an abandoned but not dead landmark, and most importantly, something that feels like *home*.  
  
I'm only starting to learn this beautiful language of game visuals.  
And I hope my translation does it justice.
