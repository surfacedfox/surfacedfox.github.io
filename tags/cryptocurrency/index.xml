      <description>Last month, I accepted a job at an outsourcing and co-development company(which shall remain unnamed) in North India. They intended to build a new game development division, and wanted someone who knows about game production, development, design, you get the idea- a one-person army more or less. It was to be a leadership position, where I would be leading a team of artists and programmers.
It was a decent position, with a comfortable salary by Indian standards.</description>
