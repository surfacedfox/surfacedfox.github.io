      <description>The ol&amp;rsquo; reliable duplicate room on the other side trick for mirrors is criminally underused, and understandably so; However, I feel that innovation related to that trick practically stopped after parallax-corrected cubemaps and screen space reflections caught on. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about that.
Parallax-corrected cubemaps are more or less perfect for 90% usecases, imo. They&amp;rsquo;re cheap, and are useful for a lot of stuff, particularly, irregular surfaces. They are pretty cool, but they&amp;rsquo;re static, so you won&amp;rsquo;t see dynamic stuff in reflections at worst, and have to recompute them at runtime for some semblance of it at best.</description>
