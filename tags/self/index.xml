      <description>It is time to stop running. Hey there. This thing still work?
It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since I was on here. My history tells me that the last time was all the way back in January, and even so, there&amp;rsquo;s hardly anything there that I&amp;rsquo;d consider noteworthy. So I guess we can start with a blank slate, now.
Lots has happened since then, and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel weirdly on edge, like things have fallen in place in a very specific way, as if the world is giving me a sign.</description>
