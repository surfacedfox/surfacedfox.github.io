      <description>The ol&amp;rsquo; reliable duplicate room on the other side trick for mirrors is criminally underused, and understandably so; However, I feel that innovation related to that trick practically stopped after parallax-corrected cubemaps and screen space reflections caught on. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about that.
Parallax-corrected cubemaps are more or less perfect for 90% usecases, imo. They&amp;rsquo;re cheap, and are useful for a lot of stuff, particularly, irregular surfaces. They are pretty cool, but they&amp;rsquo;re static, so you won&amp;rsquo;t see dynamic stuff in reflections at worst, and have to recompute them at runtime for some semblance of it at best.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m @surfacedfox, and I&amp;rsquo;m a creator!
Inspired to make games since I was 11, over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a multitude of skills in service of that goal. Be it designing and developing complex systems, or setting up a pipeline to facilitate a smooth development process, I can bridge the gap between the worlds of art and engineering. I believe interactivity is the future of storytelling, and that the best way to predict the future is to make it happen- so here we are!</description>

      <description>Here are some projects I&amp;rsquo;m proud of! Technical Assignment for Hopscotch Games: Video of the technical assessment project I worked on as a part of my job application at Hopscotch Games. Built according to this spec sheet, I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that my project far exceeded their expectations. Render Pipeline Conversion: I converted the Unity HDRP sample project to URP, gaining a massive performance boost for minimal fidelity differences! Wizards&amp;rsquo; Folly: A game I made with Team Firedreamer for GMTK Jam 2022!</description>
