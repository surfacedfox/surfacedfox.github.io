      <description>It is time to stop running. Hey there. This thing still work?
It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since I was on here. My history tells me that the last time was all the way back in January, and even so, there&amp;rsquo;s hardly anything there that I&amp;rsquo;d consider noteworthy. So I guess we can start with a blank slate, now.
Lots has happened since then, and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel weirdly on edge, like things have fallen in place in a very specific way, as if the world is giving me a sign.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Ashe O. Hawkes, and I love games, and I love to make &amp;rsquo;em!
Inspired to make games since the age of 11 and with 5 years of professional experience, I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a multitude of skills in service of that goal. Be it designing and developing complex systems, or setting up a pipeline to facilitate a smooth development process, I can bridge the gap between the worlds of art and engineering.</description>

      <description>Here are some projects I&amp;rsquo;m proud of! XScape, a realtime 3D data visualisation client, which is an integral part of the award-winning 4-Dimensional Disease Outbreak Surveillance System project. I have been working on this one at my job for a little over two years now, and it&amp;rsquo;s actively in use right now by a major hospital in Singapore! I worked on Adorae during my time at Hopscotch games. I personally took initiative to implement and design full gamepad controls for this game, which was keyboard + mouse only at the time, and designed and developed some of the minigames you see here.</description>
